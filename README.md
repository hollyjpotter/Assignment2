Part 4:
When using the mispelled words, it didn't always provide the correct output. It was more correct when the count was higher (so 7 instead of 3) since it had more chances to be correct. This could be improved if we maybe added a frequency portion like the other one where each mispelling has a frequency at which they occur. Alternatively, we can create a frequency value that will be increatmented each time the mispelling appears.
